\title{Calculate Alignment Scores}
\usage{
analyze_alignment(alignment_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{alignment_df}{A data frame containing raw survey responses. Must contain:
\itemize{
\item \code{role}: Character ('researcher' or 'partner').
\item \code{alignment}: Character (the factor/category being rated).
\item \code{rating}: Numeric (the rating provided, typically 0-1).
}}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{alignment_analysis} containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{table}: Wide-format data frame with interpolated medians.
\item \code{plot_data}: Long-format data frame suitable for ggplot2.
\item \code{icc}: The full ICC object from the \code{irr} package.
\item \code{alignment_score}: The numeric ICC value (\eqn{S_a}).
}
}
\description{
Performs a comprehensive analysis of alignment between "researcher" and "partner"
ratings using the CEnTR*IMPACT methodology. This function calculates the Intraclass
Correlation Coefficient (ICC) to derive an Alignment Score (\eqn{S_a}), alongside
descriptive statistics (interpolated medians and ranges) to visualize the gap between
perspectives.
