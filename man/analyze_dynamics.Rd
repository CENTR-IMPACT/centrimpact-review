\usage{
analyze_dynamics(dynamics_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{dynamics_df}{A data frame containing the assessment data. Required columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{domain}: Character or Factor. The broader category (e.g., "Partnerships").
\item \code{dimension}: Character or Factor. The specific metric (e.g., "Trust").
\item \code{salience}: Numeric. The importance of the dimension. Must be $0 < x \le 1$.
\item \code{weight}: Numeric. The observed intensity or presence. Must be $0 < x \le 1$.
}}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{dynamics_analysis} containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{dynamics_df}: The processed input data frame with added \code{dimension_score}.
\item \code{domain_df}: A summary data frame with aggregated scores per domain.
\item \code{dynamics_score}: A single numeric value representing the Balance Score ($S_d$), where 1 indicates perfect balance.
}
}
\description{
Implements the "Dynamics" component of the CEnTR*IMPACT framework (Price, 2024).
This function processes multidimensional assessment data to calculate domain-level
scores using geometric means and computes a "Balance Score" ($S_d$) using the
Gini coefficient. It is designed to measure the equitable distribution of effort
and impact across the core domains of the CBPR Framework (Wallerstein & Duran, 2010; Wallerstein, et al., 2020).
}
\details{
The CEnTR*IMPACT framework uses this analysis to quantify "Developmental Balance."
A higher Balance Score indicates that the project is maintaining a healthy
equilibrium across its various dimensions, rather than over-indexing on just one
area at the expense of others.

\strong{The Scoring Process:}
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Dimension Scoring:} Calculated as the geometric mean of weight and salience.
$$ Score_{dim} = \sqrt{Weight \times Salience} $$
\item \strong{Domain Scoring:} Aggregates dimension scores within each domain using the geometric mean.
\item \strong{Dynamics Scoring:} Calculated based on the inequality of domain scores.
$$ S_d = 1 - Gini(Score_{domains}) $$
}

\strong{Dynamics Score Interpretation:}
The following rule of thumb (Haddad et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2020) is used to interpret the Dynamics Score ($S_d$):
\itemize{
\item $S_d < 0.5$: \strong{Very Low Balance}
\item $0.50 \le S_d < 0.59$: \strong{Low Balance}
\item $0.60 \le S_d < 0.69$: \strong{Moderate Balance}
\item $0.70 \le S_d \le 0.79$: \strong{High Balance}
\item $S_d \ge 0.80$: \strong{Very High Balance}
}

\strong{Handling Missing Data:}
The function is permissive with partial datasets. If a domain is included in the
input but contains \code{NA} values for weights or salience, it is retained in
the output. However, if sufficient data is missing to prevent calculation, the
score will be \code{NaN}.

\examples{
# 1. Generate synthetic data using the built-in generator
# We use a fixed seed to ensure the example is reproducible
df <- generate_dynamics_data(seed = 123)

# 2. Run the Dynamics analysis
result <- analyze_dynamics(df)

# 3. Inspect the global Balance Score (Sd)
# A score closer to 1.0 indicates high balance across domains
print(result$dynamics_score)

# 4. Inspect the domain-level scores
print(result$domain_df)

# 5. Example with high-variance data (to show lower balance)
df_unbalanced <- generate_dynamics_data(seed = 123, domain_variance = TRUE)
result_unbalanced <- analyze_dynamics(df_unbalanced)
print(result_unbalanced$dynamics_score)
