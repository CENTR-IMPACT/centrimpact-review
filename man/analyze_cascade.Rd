\description{
Performs a comprehensive analysis of a network's "Cascade" structure to measure
localized influence. Based on the theory that direct personal influence typically
extends to "three degrees of impact" (Christakis & Fowler, 2009), this function
examines potential cascading effects across these layers using the formula:
\deqn{I = \gamma (\alpha L + \beta G) + \lambda T}
}
\details{
\strong{Theoretical Foundation:}
Unlike general connectivity metrics, this method resembles the work of Long,
Cunningham, and Braithwaite (2013), examining participants' roles based on the
structure of the network formed through the research. It assesses how influence
ripples outward from the core team (Layer 1) to the broader community (Layer 3+).

\strong{Operational Definitions:}
The function maps Social Network Analysis (SNA) metrics to four key influence roles:

\strong{1. Knitting (Cohesion & Bonding):}
Measures how well the network strengthens internal bonds within a specific group.
\itemize{
\item \emph{Metrics:} Community detection (Walktrap) + Eigenvector Centrality.
\item \emph{Interpretation:} High scores indicate a tight-knit, resilient core.
}

\strong{2. Bridging (Connection & Spanning):}
Measures the ability to connect otherwise disconnected groups (filling "structural holes").
\itemize{
\item \emph{Metrics:} Structural Holes (Constraint) + Betweenness Centrality.
\item \emph{Interpretation:} High scores indicate key "brokers" connecting silos.
}

\strong{3. Channeling (Flow & Transmission):}
Measures the efficiency of information flow and resource distribution.
\itemize{
\item \emph{Metrics:} Local Betweenness + Alpha Centrality.
\item \emph{Interpretation:} High scores indicate effective pipelines for moving resources.
}

\strong{4. Reaching (Access & Inclusion):}
Measures the extent of the network's periphery and accessibility.
\itemize{
\item \emph{Metrics:} Clustering Coefficient + Harmonic Centrality.
\item \emph{Interpretation:} High scores indicate an inclusive network with reduced barriers.
}

\strong{Cascade Score Interpretation:}
The "Cascade Balance Score" (\eqn{S_c}) is calculated using the inverse Gini coefficient
of layer-level scores to determine if influence is effectively distributed across
the "three degrees" or concentrated at the top.
\itemize{
\item \eqn{S_c < 0.50}: \strong{Very Low Balance} (Core-dominated)
\item \eqn{0.50 \le S_c < 0.59}: \strong{Low Balance}
\item \eqn{0.60 \le S_c < 0.69}: \strong{Moderate Balance}
\item \eqn{0.70 \le S_c \le 0.79}: \strong{High Balance}
\item \eqn{S_c \ge 0.80}: \strong{Very High Balance} (Equitable distribution)
}

\examples{
# 1. Generate a synthetic 3-layer network
# This simulates Core (L1) -> Partner (L2) -> Community (L3) flow
network_data <- generate_cascade_data(seed = 42)

# 2. Run the cascade analysis
result <- analyze_cascade(network_data)

# 3. Inspect the Global Balance Score (Sd)
# A high score (0.8+) implies influence is well-distributed across layers
print(result$cascade_score)

# 4. View the Layer Summary
# Check if "Knitting" is high in Layer 1 vs "Reaching" in Layer 3
print(result$summary)
