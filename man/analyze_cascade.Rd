\description{
Performs a comprehensive analysis of a network's "Cascade" structure to measure
localized influence. Based on the theory that direct personal influence typically
extends to "three degrees of impact" (Christakis & Fowler, 2009), this function
examines potential cascading effects across these layers.
}
\details{
\strong{Theoretical Foundation:}
Unlike general connectivity metrics, this method resembles the work of Long,
Cunningham, and Braithwaite (2013), examining participants' roles based on the
structure of the network formed through the research. It assesses how influence
ripples outward from the core team (Layer 1) to the broader community (Layer 3+).

\strong{Operational Definitions:}
The function maps Social Network Analysis (SNA) metrics to four key influence roles:

\strong{1. Knitting (Cohesion & Bonding):}
Measures how well the network strengthens internal bonds within a specific group.
\itemize{
\item \emph{Metrics:} Community detection (Walktrap) + Eigenvector Centrality.
\item \emph{Interpretation:} High scores indicate a tight-knit, resilient core.
}

\strong{2. Bridging (Connection & Spanning):}
Measures the ability to connect otherwise disconnected groups (filling "structural holes").
\itemize{
\item \emph{Metrics:} Structural Holes (Constraint) + Betweenness Centrality.
\item \emph{Interpretation:} High scores indicate key "brokers" connecting silos.
}

\strong{3. Channeling (Flow & Transmission):}
Measures the efficiency of information flow and resource distribution.
\itemize{
\item \emph{Metrics:} Local Betweenness + Alpha Centrality.
\item \emph{Interpretation:} High scores indicate effective pipelines for moving resources.
}

\strong{4. Reaching (Access & Inclusion):}
Measures the extent of the network's periphery and accessibility.
\itemize{
\item \emph{Metrics:} Clustering Coefficient + Harmonic Centrality.
\item \emph{Interpretation:} High scores indicate an inclusive network with reduced barriers.
}

\strong{The Scoring Process:}
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Layer (Degree) Scoring:} For each network layer (degree of separation),
influence is calculated by combining local cohesion (Knitting + Bridging),
global flow (Channeling), and peripheral access (Reaching):
\deqn{s_{\text{layer}} = \gamma(\alpha L + \beta G) + \lambda T}
where \eqn{L} represents combined Knitting and Bridging scores, \eqn{G} represents
Channeling score, \eqn{T} represents Reaching score, and weights are:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{\alpha = 0.4} (local cohesion weight)
\item \eqn{\beta = 0.3} (global flow weight)
\item \eqn{\lambda = 0.3} (peripheral access weight)
\item \eqn{\gamma} varies by layer: 0.9 (Layer 1), 0.5 (Layer 2), 0.45 (Layer 3)
}
\item \strong{Cascade Balance Score:} Calculated based on the equality of layer scores.
\deqn{S_{c} = 1 - \operatorname{Gini}(\{s_{\text{layer},k}\})}
where \eqn{\{s_{\text{layer},k}\}} represents the set of all layer influence scores.
}

\strong{Cascade Balance Interpretation:}
\itemize{
\item \eqn{S_c < 0.50}: \strong{Very Low Balance} (Core-dominated)
\item \eqn{0.50 \le S_c < 0.59}: \strong{Low Balance}
\item \eqn{0.60 \le S_c < 0.69}: \strong{Moderate Balance}
\item \eqn{0.70 \le S_c \le 0.79}: \strong{High Balance}
\item \eqn{S_c \ge 0.80}: \strong{Very High Balance} (Equitable distribution)
}

\examples{
# 1. Generate a synthetic 3-layer network
# This simulates Core (L1) -> Partner (L2) -> Community (L3) flow
network_data <- generate_cascade_data(seed = 42)

# 2. Run the cascade analysis
result <- analyze_cascade(network_data)

# 3. Inspect the Global Balance Score (Sd)
# A high score (0.8+) implies influence is well-distributed across layers
print(result$cascade_score)

# 4. View the Layer Summary
# Check if "Knitting" is high in Layer 1 vs "Reaching" in Layer 3
print(result$summary)
