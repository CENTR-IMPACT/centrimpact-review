\title{Visualize Rater Alignment (Slopegraph)}
\usage{
visualize_alignment(
  analysis_object,
  project_title = "Project Alignment Visualization",
  color_palette = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{analysis_object}{An object of class \code{alignment_analysis} produced by \code{\link{analyze_alignment}}.}

\item{project_title}{String. The title of the plot. Defaults to "Project Alignment Visualization".}

\item{color_palette}{Named vector of colors. If \code{NULL}, a colorblind-friendly hue palette is generated automatically.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object that can be further customized (e.g., adding themes or changing labels).
}
\description{
Creates a slopegraph to visualize the alignment (or divergence) between "Partner" and
"Researcher" ratings. This visualization style highlights changes in rank and magnitude
between two groups, making it immediately apparent where perspectives align or conflict.
}
\details{
\strong{Methodology:}
The slopegraph, introduced by Edward Tufte (1983), is the preferred method for comparing
gradients of change or difference between two distinct states (in this case, two distinct
stakeholder roles).

\strong{Interpretation:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Flat Lines:} Indicate perfect alignment (Partners and Researchers agree on the rating).
\item \strong{Steep Slopes:} Indicate divergence (One group values the factor significantly higher than the other).
\item \strong{Crossing Lines:} Indicate a difference in \emph{priority} or \emph{ranking} (e.g., Partners rate "Goals" highest, while Researchers rate it lowest).
}
The plot includes the Alignment Score (\eqn{S_a}) in the subtitle, providing a quick summary statistic
alongside the visual detail.

\examples{
# 1. Generate and analyze data
data <- generate_alignment_data()
results <- analyze_alignment(data)

# 2. Create the visualization
p <- visualize_alignment(results, project_title = "Year 1 Alignment")

# 3. Display the plot
print(p)
