\usage{
generate_alignment_data(seed = Sys.time())
}
\arguments{
\item{seed}{Integer or POSIXct. The seed for random number generation. Defaults to \code{Sys.time()}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns: \code{alignment}, \code{role}, and \code{rating}.
}
\description{
Generates synthetic data to simulate "Alignment"—the degree of agreement between different
stakeholders (Researchers and Partners) across key project areas.
}
\details{
This function simulates a survey response dataset where multiple participants (Researchers and Partners)
rate their agreement or alignment on various axes (Goals, Values, Roles, etc.).

\strong{Logic:}
\itemize{
\item Randomly selects a number of researchers (1-10) and partners (Researcher Count + 1 to 15).
\item Generates alignment ratings (0.36 to 1.00) for 8 categories.
\item Useful for visualizing gaps in understanding or expectation between stakeholder groups.
