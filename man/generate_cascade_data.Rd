\usage{
generate_cascade_data(seed = Sys.time())
}
\arguments{
\item{seed}{Integer or POSIXct. The seed for random number generation. Defaults to \code{Sys.time()}.}
}
\value{
A data frame representing the edge list with columns: \code{from}, \code{to}, and \code{layer}.
}
\description{
Generates synthetic network data to simulate a multi-layered network
showing how impact diffuses from primary agents (Layer 1) to secondary (Layer 2) and tertiary (Layer 3) actors.
}
\details{
This function constructs a directed graph structure (represented as an edge list) with three distinct layers.
It uses an optimized, vectorized approach to generate connections based on probabilistic rules defined
in the CEnTR*IMPACT framework.

\strong{Network Logic:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Layer 1:} A fully connected clique of primary agents (3-10 nodes).
\item \strong{Layer 2:} Children of Layer 1 (1-3 children per parent). 36\% chance of internal connections.
\item \strong{Layer 3:} Children of Layer 2 (parents selected with 72\% probability). 10\% chance of internal connections.
