\usage{
visualize_dynamics(
  analysis_object,
  project_title = "Project Dynamics Visualization"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{analysis_object}{An object of class \code{dynamics_analysis}. This list must contain:
\itemize{
\item \code{dynamics_df}: A data frame with columns \code{domain}, \code{dimension},
\code{domain_score}, and \code{dimension_value}.
\item \code{dynamics_score}: A single numeric value representing the overall system score (\eqn{S_d}).
}}

\item{project_title}{String. The title of the plot. Defaults to "Project Dynamics Visualization".}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object.
}
\description{
Creates a "Rose" or "Coxcomb" chart to visualize the developmental balance of a project.
Inspired by Florence Nightingale's historic diagrams, this plot wraps a bar chart around
a central point, allowing for the comparison of cyclical or categorized data without
the visual bias of linear rank.
}
\details{
\strong{Historical Context:}
This visualization is adapted from the "Diagram of the Causes of Mortality in the Army in the East"
by Florence Nightingale (1858). Just as her diagram highlighted disproportionate causes of death,
this chart highlights disproportionate strengths or weaknesses in project infrastructure.

\strong{Visual Metaphor:}
The chart separates data into two distinct layers to show both the "Forest" (Domain)
and the "Trees" (Dimensions):
\itemize{
\item \strong{Petals (Background Wedges):} Represent the aggregated \emph{Domain} score.
These form the background "fan." If a Domain is strong, its petal reaches the outer edge (1.0).
If weak, it shrinks toward the center.
\item \strong{Stamen (Foreground Lollipops):} Represent the specific \emph{Dimension} values.
These radiating lines allow you to see if a specific dimension (e.g., "Trust") is lagging
behind its parent Domain (e.g., "Partnerships").
}

\strong{Interpretation:}
A well-balanced project will appear as a full, nearly circular bloom. Gaps or "wilted" sectors
indicate areas of the project infrastructure (Context, Partnerships, Research, Learning, Outcomes)
that require attention.
